As stated by the problem, the duration for each car is 54000 and the amount of cars is 8. Therefore the total duration over all the cars is 432000. Given the total duration taken from the city streets is less than 432000. The 8 cars should be able to traverse all the given streets in the time limit.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = JuliaHashcode","category":"page"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Documentation for JuliaHashcode.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Modules = [JuliaHashcode]","category":"page"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.Car","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.Car","text":"Car\n\nStore a car made of the car's path, duration, and if it's still running.\n\nFields\n\npath::Vector{Int}: path the car has traveled\nduration::Int: total duration the car has traveled\nis_running::Bool: tells if the car is still running or reached end of duration\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.Solution","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.Solution","text":"Solution\n\nStore a set of itineraries, one for each car.\n\nFields\n\ncity::City: Set of parameters from problem\nitineraries::Vector{Vector{Int}}: each itinerary is a vector of junction indices\nfeasible::Bool: tells if the solution is feasible given the city\ntotal::Int: total is the total distance the cars travel in the solution\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.calculate_totals-Tuple{City}","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.calculate_totals","text":"calculate_totals(city)\n\nCalculate total street distance and street durations for the entire city.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.find_best_path-Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64, Int64, Vector{HashCode2014.Street}, Dict{HashCode2014.Street, Bool}, Dict{Int64, Vector{HashCode2014.Street}}, Int64}","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.find_best_path","text":"find_best_path(depth, total_depth, duration, total_duration, streets, visited, neighboring_streets, current_position)\n\nRuns a recursive greedy algorithm to find the best path of length total_depth from current_position making sure it doesn't exceed duration\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.get_street_end-Tuple{Integer, HashCode2014.Street}","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.get_street_end","text":"get_street_end(i, street)\n\nRetrieve the arrival endpoint of street when it starts at junction i.\n\nFrom HashCode2014\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.greedy_algo-Tuple{City}","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.greedy_algo","text":"greedy_algo(problem)\n\nRuns a greedy algorithm for each car to find the best paths to achieve the highest score.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#JuliaHashcode.is_feasible-Tuple{Vector{Vector{Int64}}, City}","page":"Home","title":"JuliaHashcode.is_feasible","text":"is_feasible(solution, city[; verbose=false])\n\nCheck if solution satisfies the constraints for the instance defined by city.
