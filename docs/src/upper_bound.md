# Proving upper bound

The upper bound of the street view routing problem is based on if the total duration of all the streets is lower than the max duration multiplied by the total cars. As stated by the problem, the duration for each car is 54000 and the amount of cars is 8. Therefore the total duration over all the cars is 432000. Given the total duration taken from the city streets is less than 432000. The 8 cars should be able to traverse all the given streets in the time limit.
